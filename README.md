# The Accessibility (a11y) Wishlist

Inspired by a thread started on the [A11Y Slack](https://web-a11y.slack.com/archives/C042TSFGN/p1709304627901339), I decided to create this repository as a place for folks to share their wish list items concerning challenges in the digital accessibility space.

## How to contribute

Open an issue and share your wish list item. If you have a solution in mind, please share that as well. If you don't, that's okay too. We can work together to find a solution. If an issue exists, add a thumbs up. If you have an idea of how to solve an existing issue or believe it has been or is being addressed, let us know in the issue comments. Thanks for contributing!
