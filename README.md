# The Accessibility (a11y) Wishlist

Inspired by a thread started on the [A11Y Slack](https://web-a11y.slack.com/archives/C042TSFGN/p1709304627901339), I decided to create this repository as a place for folks to share their wish list items concerning challenges in the digital accessibility space.

## How to contribute

Open and issue and share your wish list item. If you have a solution in mind, please share that as well. If you don't, that's okay too. We can work together to find a solution. Thanks for contributing!
